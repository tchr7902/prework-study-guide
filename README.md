# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was made in order to organize notes and important information I have learned throughout the Prework of the Bootcamp.

The webpage allows for easy access of some information I will need throughout the bootcamp, and has taught me the fundamentals of the topics contained in the prework.

## Usage

Accessing the webpage shows you a list of information taught throughout the prework course. There are 4 different sections, all of which contain a topic and important information pertaining to that topic and understanding its fundamentals. 

When the DevTools console is opened, the JavaScript contained in the webpage displays a message on the different topics taught throughout prework, and a random topic for us to study.
